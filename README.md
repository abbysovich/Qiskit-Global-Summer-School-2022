## About
The annual Qiskit Global Summer School 2022 was an IBM-hosted, two-week-long program from July 18-29. The school is meant to act as a means of education for Quantum Computing enthusiasts. This year's topic was the field of Quantum Simulation, which arguably constitutes one of the fundamental reasons as to why we need quantum computers. After all, as Richard Feynman put it, "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical."

The summer school provided lectures from famous researchers at IBM, including Dr. Olivia Lanes, Maria Violaris and Dr. Zlatko Minev. It was thrilling to learn directly from individuals whose online content I watched extensively prior to the program. In addition, students got to put their learning to the test by means of the four lab assignments, which illustrated the usage of Qiskit in performing Quantum Simulations.

This repository contains the four lab assignments and my solutions to them. I hope you are able to learn from these notebooks as I have.
